Description:
  Sonar Messaging is a simple cloud based messaging app that uses location 
  services to connect you with the people closest to you. As one of the most 
  popular past times of our generation, sending selfies has been incorporated 
  into Sonar Messaging by giving you a dedicated "Send Photo" button alongside 
  normal text messages. Our cloud processing will automatically find and 
  highlight any faces it finds within the image, in addition, it will highlight
  each face with a specific colour depending on the person's mood. 
    (Green = Happy, Red = Angry, Blue = Sad, White = Neutral)
